# django-iframe

### Status - Under development

# Current
1. Clone the django application:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/meetmangukiya/django-iframe.git
    ```

2. Run the application locally:
    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Features
1. Queue the videos by ID by passing the ids in parameters like:

    `https://localhost:<port>/?id=<id1>&id=<id2>...`
2. Control the playback quality of the loaded videos:

    E.g.: `?quality=low`

# Future
This repo will probably evolve into an integrable django app for YouTube Iframe API in near future.
